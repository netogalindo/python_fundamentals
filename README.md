A repository with files from when I was learning Python

Hi, I'm Neto. I love Java and I'm beginning to love Python as well. I love QA and I love English.

For this specific project, I've decided to add the files (Not the entire project), to use them as stand-alone functions.
When I do create an entire Python project, with functions, classes etc connected to each other, I will use a local repository.
